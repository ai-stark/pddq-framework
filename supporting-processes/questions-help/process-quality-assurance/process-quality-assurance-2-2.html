	<p>Any variation in the performance of a process will impact downstream activities along the patient demographic data lifecycle – existing process defects, as well as new improvements, are no exception. Accordingly, communicating process changes to all relevant stakeholders across the patient demographic data lifecycle is essential.</p>

	<p>In some cases, negative impacts on other processes may be incurred to support the greater goal of patient safety (e.g., writing ‘Jane Doe’ as the name of an unconscioius emergency room patient). Without a a mechanism for monitoring process improvement compliance, adoption of changes is likely to be compromised. This illustrates the role of governance to collectively review process improvement recommendations and indicate potential negative impacts.</p>
