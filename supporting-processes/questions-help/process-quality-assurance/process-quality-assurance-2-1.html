	<p>Process improvements should be made through careful analysis of the steps performed ensuring that they accomplish the objectives for the process. While the specific purpose of data management processes varies along the continuum of patient care, many will share steps at a high-level, due to the commonality of the data. If these processes are performed differently, the quality of the data can be negatively impacted.</p>

	<p>Process standards support consistent performance along the lifecycle of patient demographic data promoting resource efficiency, resource mobility, and fewer data defects. Documentation of process standards, descriptions, and procedures enables the objective evaluation of important processes impacting data quality, such as registration intake, checking for duplicates, informing originating sources about duplicates, changes to standards, etc.</p>
