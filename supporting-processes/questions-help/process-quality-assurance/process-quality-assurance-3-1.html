	<p>Establishing and adopting process standards, descriptions, and procedures is not enough to ensure that results are improved across the patient demographic data lifecycle. The one-to-many relationships between standards and the implemented environment pose risks for any changes that may result in unanticipated negative impacts on the quality of patient data and ultimately on patient care.</p>

	<p>Standard process quality measures and metrics support the objective evaluation of the effects of process improvements, especially in a complex chain of linked activities where little informal communication may occur between the various stages of care. In such cases, standard measures and metrics clearly communicate performance expectations that support the overall objective of patient safety for participants in every related process, as well as fostering achievement of data quality objectives.</p>
