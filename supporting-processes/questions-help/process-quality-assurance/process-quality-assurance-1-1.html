	<p>Issues in process performance and corresponding work products can be triggered by a variety of internal and external circumstances. In some cases, poor quality of data inputs to the process may be a root cause of process quality issues. In other cases, the data inputs may be sufficient, but the process corrupts the quality of the data outputs.  Whatever the case, process quality and data quality are interdependent and should be considered together.</p>

	<p>For example, duplicate patient records can result from inadequate controls during the original registration of a patient. Without considering the quality of the process, the root issue may go undetected and result in repeated data cleansing by downstream consumers of the data.</p>

	<p>Alternatively, process quality issues may result from lower throughput of patients in the registration process, holding up the delivery of care due to redundant manual steps in the patient registration process. However, the redundant steps may have been performed to reduce negative impacts on patient identity integrity. In this case there is a risk that process improvements in the registration process may result in more duplicate records inadvertently impacting downstream consumers of the data.</p>
