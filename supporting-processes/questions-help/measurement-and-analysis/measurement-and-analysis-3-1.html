	<p>Metrics can serve as a powerful form of communication. They can convey in simple terms complex behavior and serve as the basis for making rational decisions that not only lead to, but quantitatively define, success. While it is important to invest in the development of key metrics for patient demographic data quality, it is equally important to invest in analyzing and interpreting results.</p>

	<p>Metrics rarely speak for themselves. Stakeholders need full disclosure on what is being presented. Metrics and objectives need to be precisely defined, so that the rationale for measuring and analyzing is understood. Quantitative thresholds help stakeholders to understand how good is good enough (See Data Quality Assessment). If charts are used, axes should be labeled. Legends should be employed so that color coding, shapes, and other discriminating visual characteristics can be clearly understood.</p>

	<p>Analysts should succinctly state conclusions where possible, pose considerations or questions that should be contemplated, and if there are key patterns that support conclusions, they should be visually identified using arrows, captions, boxes, or other methods of drawing attention to what is important.</p>
