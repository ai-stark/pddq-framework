	<p>Metrics and objectives should reflect the actual changes in patient demographic data quality impacting key stakeholders and business goals. Developing a reliable set of metrics and objectives is an iterative process. Once baseline of key performance indicators has been established, standards for data collections, storage, and analysis should be clearly specified.</p>

	<p>At different points along the patient demographic data lifecycle, duplicate rates on patient records may be measured using different inputs and methods. While this may be appropriate for a specific purpose, it may also be discovered that inconsistent and valid definitions of “duplicate” exist. Inconsistently defined metrics can be compared in certain types of analysis where the differences in meaning are known. However, inconsistent metrics should never be aggregated.  Data quality considerations should be established, used, and maintained for the measurement repository, and should be monitored by data governance.</p>
