	<p>Objectives establish the context for understanding what a metric is measuring, and why it matters. The organization should agree on the factors that will drive patient demographic data quality, set objectives for them, measure key activities, and then monitor them for progress.</p>

	<p>The factors that impact patient demographic data quality span across all data management processes. However, the relative importance of each factor will depend on the organizationâ€™s complexity, culture, and current capabilities.</p>

	<p>An important first step is to establish a baseline measure of the quality of critical patient demographic data attributes across the lifecycle (See Data Quality Assessment). Then, as decisions and investments are made to support the data management infrastructure, positive impacts on the goal can be monitored, and efforts can be adjusted with confidence.</p>
