	<p>Process improvements are specific changes that will better align activities and outputs with goals and objectives. Improvement opportunities will arise as the result of changes in goals and objectives, from formal or informal process quality assessments (<em>See Process Quality Assessment</em>), as well as from periodic process assessments.  It is important for the organization to assign responsibility for process management, to coordinate improvements to processes, standards, and procedures.</p>

	<p>Data governance will usually be the leader in data management process improvement efforts, because it collectively represents an organization-wide perspective and is responsible to ensure that standards and guidelines are implemented consistently across the patient demographic data lifecycle.</p>
