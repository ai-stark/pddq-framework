	<p>An effective process delivers benefits that outweigh the costs. Benefits and costs can be quanitified in many ways (e.g., effort, time, money, reputation, culture, and staff retention). The organization should identify and prioritize costs and benefits in the context of its goals and objectives.</p>

	<p>Periodic evaluation of processes should evaluate selected costs and benefits to identify opportunities to improve process effectiveness. Proposed changes to processes should be evaluated for impacts prior to implementation to avoid unecessarily imposing burdens on staff roles that might compromise patient demographic data quality and threaten patient safety.</p>
