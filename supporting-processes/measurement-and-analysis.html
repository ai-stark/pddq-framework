	<h4>Purpose</h4>

	<p>Provides practices that enable an organization to develop a meaningful measurement capability to support milestone tracking and monitoring of the effectiveness of data management activities.</p>

	<h4>Introductory Notes</h4>

	<p>An organization instituting a data management program or enhancing existing data management processes needs to determine how progress and improvements will be measured.  The organization can expect that business representatives, information technology staff, managers, and executives will want to know what is being achieved in return for the effort and expense incurred, since developing and implementing new processes also ushers in some changes to the current state of work as usual.</p>

	<p>Meaningful measures and metrics, once defined and approved by relevant stakeholders through governance, are an effective communication and monitoring mechanism.  Capabilities for developing measures and metrics include abilities to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Define objectives – what should the organization measure and why;</li>
		<li>Obtain and store – how will measures be captured, where will they be stored, how will they be made available;</li>
		<li>Analyze and interpret – how the measures and metrics will be used and what the consensus is on their meaning;</li>
		<li>Evaluate progress and the effectiveness of measured process – monitoring against objectives, using results to improve the process;</li>
		<li>Report to relevant audiences – how, and how often, will results be reported to relevant stakeholders and management; and</li>
		<li>Interpret results and evaluate impacts to identify remediation actions.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>For the purpose of data management, measures and metrics can be confused as these terms are often not used precisely.  In the context of this document, they are defined as followed:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Measure</strong> - a count that is collected, and presents a quantified result that is used for reporting and monitoring. Measures may initially be applied to create a baseline and tracked to gauge improvements. Examples of measures include: number of defects, transaction counts, and number of duplicates.</li>
		<li><strong>Metric</strong> - specifies the quantification of measures to derive business meaning. Specifically, a metric defines the calculation method (+, -, *, /, %, etc.) and unit of measure(s), as well as the meaning and context of the specified measurements.  Examples of metrics include: percentage of records with one or more missing data elements, percentage of unmatched records, rate of matching percentage improvement by month, etc.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Over the past few decades, data management as a set of organized disciplines has lagged in overall capabilities compared to software development and engineering.  Even organizations which have a set of sensible measures and metrics in place for IT, such as number of defects, defect rates, delivery times for lifecycle phases, error classifications (e.g. severe, moderate, minor) etc., do not typically build in measures and metrics for data management products and activities as they are established.  This is unfortunate, because metrics serve a number of important purposes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Progress tracking</strong> – those involved with performing the process can track achievements against milestones and monitor results to demonstrate how effective their efforts have been according to the baseline.  This information by itself has been proven to improve outcomes and also serves to motivate staff.</li>
		<li><strong>Management visibility</strong> – managers and executives can make better decisions about resources, costs, and priorities based on meaningful metrics.</li>
		<li><strong>Funding justification</strong> – a set of measures and metrics, established according to objectives and maintained and published, increases the likelihood of continuing to receive funding for important work.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Establishing metrics for data management processes (e.g. number of data stores profiled, number of defects, number of unmatched patient records, matching rates over time, etc.) and products (e.g. number of data elements for which metadata is complete, number of development projects following data standards, number of noncompliance occurrences, etc.) reveals issues to be resolved, provides objective feedback to stakeholders, and maintains alignment of data management to business objectives.  It is recommended to start with one key data management process area or one well-defined subset of data, to allow stakeholders to learn the measurement definition process. Involved staff will quickly gain in skill at developing useful measures and metrics once they have engaged in the steps of the process together.</p>

	<p>Measurement and analysis provides valuable information about the performance of data management efforts, through a sequenced approach including the following steps.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Specifying the objectives for measures and metrics to ensure that they are aligned with identified information needs and objectives.
			<ul>
				<li>Gain agreement on a ‘vision of the good’ – objectives for the process area, e.g., lower the number of patient records with missing demographic data; and</li>
				<li>Determine what can be quantitatively demonstrated to gain insight into progress toward the objectives.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>Specifying measures, analysis techniques, and mechanisms for data collection, storage of measurement data, reporting, and feedback.
			<ul>
				<li>Determine how the quantitative information can be captured;</li>
				<li>Decide when the baseline will be conducted;</li>
				<li>Decide where the measurement data will be stored; and</li>
				<li>Determine the stakeholders who should be informed.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>Implementing the analysis techniques and mechanisms for data collection, data reporting, and feedback.
			<ul>
				<li>Precisely define the measures (i.e., counts) and metrics (i.e., calculations) and decide how they will be interpreted; and</li>
				<li>Define a reporting standard, channel, and frequency – e.g., governance will receive detailed and summary metrics monthly, executives will receive quarterly summary reports, a dashboard will be available to all interested parties, etc.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>Providing objective results that can be used in making informed decisions and taking appropriate remediation action.
			<ul>
				<li>Develop decision criteria for management that assists in determining if changes to priorities or resources are necessary to achieve the objectives.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The integration of measurement and analysis activities into data management processes enables the following capabilities:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Objective validation of facts about improvements against the measures;</li>
		<li>Alignment of measures to one or more business decisions;</li>
		<li>Engagement of relevant stakeholders in developing and employing measures and metrics;</li>
		<li>Increased transparency by making key measures and metrics visible and accessible; and</li>
		<li>Periodic evaluation of measurement data to ensure that it remains useful.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It is difficult to overstate the benefits that the organization can realize by intentionally evolving its business processes to embed the definition and use of metrics.  Benefits include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Focuses and motivates improvement efforts, what gets measured gets accomplished;</li>
		<li>Enables prediction towards objectives and reduces estimation risk;</li>
		<li>Increases accuracy of estimating time, effort, and recourses;</li>
		<li>Improves resource productivity through objective analysis of work and by a stronger focus on objectives;</li>
		<li>Reveals actual vs. planned progress;</li>
		<li>Identifies and resolves process related issues;</li>
		<li>Informs assessment if current progress will lead to achievement of goals; and</li>
		<li>Provides evidence of progress to support funding for data improvements.</li>
	</ul>
