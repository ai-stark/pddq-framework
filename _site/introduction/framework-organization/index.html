		<h3 id="framework-org" class="subheading">Framework Organization</h3>
		<p>Although each process area can be considered separately, the collection of practices across process areas work together to ensure that the organization has comprehensively addressed fundamental data management best practices. Process area relationships and dependencies exist but are not explicit, because each process area is designed to be evaluated individually; however, these relationships are addressed in supporting informative text and also implied by the collective example work products.</p>

		<p>Each process area is composed of the same components, as illustrated in Figure 3.</p> 
		
		<p><strong>Figure 3: Process Area Components</strong></p>   

		<p>For evaluation purposes, only consensus answers to the key questions are recorded and scored in the accompanying scoring spreadsheet. The introduction to each process area and the explanatory content following the key questions provide additional context for which to interpret the question.</p>

		<p>Collectively, the existence of work products helps the organization to determine the extent to which processes are defined and being followed.  The example work products provide insight into typical artifacts – documents, templates, mechanisms, metrics, etc. – which are created as processes are developed, established, maintained, and improved.  They are presented as helpful examples for the organization to consider.   Key questions, reflecting capabilities within a process area, are organized in successive levels of achievements, synthesized from the experience of hundreds of organizations over the past three decades.  The PDDQ Framework organizes these progressive levels in ‘Tiers.’ Tier 1 Foundational address capabilities that are typically accomplished first, Tier 2 Building questions target capabilities that build on the foundation of Tier 1, and Tier 3 Advanced features capabilities that comprise completion of the practices necessary for a sound and sustainable program for managing patient demographic data across the lifecycle.</p>

		<h4>Scoring</h4>

		<p>In general, a score of 3.0 in any process area indicates that an organization is managing its data very effectively with respect to the featured practices. However, organizations should not be discouraged if the initial score is lower.  The intent of the PDDQ Framework can be stated as “Wherever you are, there you are.”  It is intended to be an encouraging and helpful mechanism for discovery, to assist organizations on their path to effectively managing patient data.  Each question can be answered in three ways:  Full means that the organization’s consensus opinion is that it is indeed performing the practices indicated.  Partial means the consensus is that portions of the practices are being performed. None means that at the time of the evaluation, the practices indicated by the question are not being performed. Each Tier must be answered as Full to receive the maximum score.  If Tier 1 is Partial and Tier 2 is Full, the organization will receive a score of .5 instead of 2.0.  However, the organization may discover that the effort to complete Tier 1 is not extensive; in that case, the impact of implementing Tier 1 practices fully would raise the score to 2.0.</p>

		<p>Each process area is scored individually, and the scoring spreadsheet provides four views of the current state:</p>
		<ul>
		  	<li>Question view, consisting of the scores, existing work products, and discussion notes for each question;</li>
		  	<li>Process Area view, consisting of the total score for that area;</li>
		  	<li>Category view, consisting of the average score for all process areas within a category; and</li>
		  	<li>Summary view, consisting of a chart that outlines the organization’s score for each process area within a single chart, presenting a visual summary of results.</li>
		</ul>
