	<h3 id="dm-function" class="subheading">Data Mangement Function</h3>
	
	<h4>Purpose</h4>

	<p>Provides data management resources to ensure that patient demographic data is managed effectively as a organizational asset, providing oversight and support to establish and maintain data management best practices, facilitate adoption, and ensure utilization.</p>

	<h4>Introductory Notes</h4>

	<p>The data management function is a core set of business processes, such as Finance, Human Resources, or Facilities Management, that provides resources to facilitate the establishment and adoption of best practices across data management disciplines, and which will always be needed across the full lifecycle of patient demographic data.</p>

	<p>The scope of the data management role will vary according to the size of the organization and its span of control over patient demographic data assets. For a small organization, the role may be fulfilled by one person, part-time; for larger organizations with a greater span of control over the data, a multi-person organization may be required. However, the essential concept is to assign accountability for persistent work products that the organization builds and maintains over time. Examples of these work products include data management policy and process documentation and quality rules that are developed to improve the quality of patient demographic data.</p>

	<p>The plan for data management resources should be based on the organization’s goals (e.g., to improve patient care and safety), objectives (e.g., eliminating duplicate patient records), and priorities.  For example, an important task would be to create quality rules to address defects discovered in a central data store receiving patient demographic data from multiple sources.</p>

	<p>The goals of recognizing a distinct data management function are to: institute responsibilities, authorities, and accountability over key data management assets; help ensure the adoption of consistent policies, processes, and standards; and align with data governance on data management priorities and decisions.  The benefits of implementing a recognized data management role include:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Raising data awareness across the organization;</li>
		<li>Facilitating implementation of best practices, in collaboration with governance representatives;</li>
		<li>Reducing duplicative efforts by promoting best practices; and</li>
		<li>Fostering adoption of data-related processes, standards, and guidelines.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In most organizations, the data management function has typically originated within IT and was closely linked to the design and implementation of data stores. As organizations have moved toward appreciating the criticality and value of their data assets, the data management function has become more of a business function. The data management role is increasingly becoming a business-centric leadership role for implementing data management capabilities and conducting compliance actitivities. For example, the data management function maintains the continutity of governance activities, such as the creation and maintenance of the organization’s business glossary and metadata.</p>

	<p>The success of data management depends on business ownership of its goals and objectives. The lines of accountability and responsibility for data management activities are typically communicated in an organizational chart, an interaction diagram, and often using a Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed (RACI) matrix.  In a larger organization, it may be useful to document the mission, objectives, and responsibilities of the data management function in the form of a charter. However, even in a very small organization, it is advised to consider recognition and assignment of this role.</p>

	<h3 class="subheading">Practice Evaluation Questions</h3>

	<h4>Tier 1: Foundational</h4>

	<ul>
		<li><p>1.1 Is a data governance structure defined and established with roles, responsibilities, and accountability assigned to all supplying and consuming business units involved in activities and decisions about patient demographic data?</p></li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Tier 2: Building</h4>

	<ul>
		<li><p>2.1 Does data governance follow defined policies and processes?</p></li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Tier 3: Advanced</h4>

	<ul>
		<li><p>3.1 Does data governance define and approve appropriate metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of quality improvements to patient demographic data?</p></li>
		<li><p>3.2 Is training in data governance processes available and required for participating stakeholders?</p></li>
	</ul>
