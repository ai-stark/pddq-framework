	<p>The integrated data environment is a hub that brings together mutiple sources and uses of shared data. As a result, many stakeholders are impacted by changes to data sources, rules, and targets. Downstream applications typically utilize custom rules to filter and relate data from the integrated environment in support of specific business purposes. If downstream consumers are not involved, changes can have significant downstream impacts.</p>

	<p>For example, were a Billing Code of “P” to change to “R”, all downstream systems that automatically select records where Billing Code = “P” would fail to find current records. Typically, data governance will inform and coordinate relevant stakeholders to vet proposed changes to the integrated environment. It is also important to update metadata with any changes to data labels, descriptions, values, and relationships.</p>
