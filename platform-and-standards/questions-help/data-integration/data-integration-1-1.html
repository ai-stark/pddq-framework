	<p>Data governance should identify relevant stakeholders along the patient demographic data lifecycle and facilitate collaboration among them to establish integration policies and processes. Working groups can be convened to ensure that data integration requirements are specified with representation from all relevant stakeholders.</p>

The approach will include agreements on data precedence rules based on real world scenarios, data requirements, and selected triggers that will satisfy business objectives.</p>

	<p>In addition, the data integration effort should include guidance for a change control process to ensure that changes to the integration environment, including upstream sources and downstream targets, are controlled and kept in alignment.</p>
