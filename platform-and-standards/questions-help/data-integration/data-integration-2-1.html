	<p>Patient data goes through internal and external processes that are related from the standpoint of patient care, but often are not linked through direct data feeds. At key points along the care continuum, patient records may need to be integrated to present a complete set of patient information or to generate consolidated statements for billing and reporting that require combining selected attributes from multiple sources into a single record.</p> 

	<p>Quality rules and matching algorithms are employed for standardizing and merging duplicate records, as well as linking information created by multiple unlinked processes back to a single patient record. The set of data integration rules used by the organization facilitates data transfer and loading, detects and captures data changes from upstream sources, captures metadata, and applies in-line data quality checks and controls, e.g., merging algorithms and exception reports on unmerged candidate duplicate records.</p>
