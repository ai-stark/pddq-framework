	<p>Organizational data requirements (e.g., cirtical patient demographic data attributes) and quality rules should be collaboratively developed by relevant stakeholders representing key data transformation points along the patient demographic data lifecycle.  When applied to build or buy decisions and selection among competing options or products, they will ensure that stakeholder business needs are met. Data governance provides guidance for the data management platform through policies and standards, and facilitates collaboration among stakeholders to make major platform decisions.</p>
