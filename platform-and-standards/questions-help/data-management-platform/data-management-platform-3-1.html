	<p>It is important for the platform to meet the requirements for performing critical data managment processes across the data lifecycle (<em>See Data Lifecycle Management</em>) for critical patient demographic data attributes. In addition, capturing and analyzing metrics on system performance, data quality, and data throughput support the monitoring of platform effectiveness against organizational objectives and requirements.  Expected service levels for consumers of data should be explicitly stated in service level agreements.</p>

	<p>The goal is to maximize data delivery across the lifecycle with zero defects, with minimal manual effort applied only at key points along the continuum of care. The optimal platform will not only be trusted as a source of high quality data but will be sufficiently flexible and extensible to accommodate changing needs without compromising data quality.</p>
