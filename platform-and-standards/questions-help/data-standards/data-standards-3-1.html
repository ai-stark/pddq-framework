	<p>Gaining broad adherence to selected standards can be challenging. It is important to take a consistent approach and to emphasize the criticality of effective communication. Specifically, standards and policy announcements should establish an effective date and require that any deviations must be posted after that date (<em>See Communications</em>).</p>

	<p>Selected standards tend to be applied to new technology purchases and development. For example, the consideration for requiring certified Health IT Modules to capture the data attributes that would be required for standardized patient identifying attributes.</p>

	<p>Applying standards retroactively can be prohibitively expensive, and in some cases the technologies in the legacy environment cannot be changed. When data standards cannot be physically implemented, they should be included in the documentation for the implemented environment (<em>See Metadata Management</em>) with cross-referencing between the standard and the existing system architecture to ensure traceability of critical attributes across the patient demographic data lifecycle (<em>See Data Lifecycle Management</em>).</p>
