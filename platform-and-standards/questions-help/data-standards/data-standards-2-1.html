	<p>Successful adoption requires data standards to be relevant and meaningful to the people who interact directly with the data. For example, data representation standards should be developed based on approved business terms. If the organization develops its own standards instead of adopting those provided by a vendor or used by an industry association, governance representatives, who are responsible for creating, reading, updating, and deleting patient demographic data, should be involved in standards development.</p>

	<p>The use of data standards ensures that consistent data descriptions and values persist across the patient data lifecycle, in new data stores, and over time, in redesign of legacy data stores in conformance with standards.  The broader the adoption is within the organization, the greater the benefit. Accordingly, governance is needed to coordinate business stakeholders to maximize adoption and promote consistent use.</p>
