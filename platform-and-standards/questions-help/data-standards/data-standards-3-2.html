	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>
	
	<p>Industry standards for data architecture are established to improve interoperability vertically along the supply chain, as well as horizontally among peer organizations. Many healthcare organizations share data but do not have a common standard. Consequently, they experience significant decreases in match rates when exchanging data. This has been evident even among organizations that have high internal patient demographic record matching rates.</p>

	<p>The development of standard data attributes cannot occur accidentally. Accordingly, regulators and industry organizations typically play a critical role in motivating the creation and adoption of data architecture standards. To take an example from another industry, the Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Organization (MISMO) was created in 1999 to develop a common language for the exchange of information across the residential finance industry. While most regulators and housing agencies now require MISMO standards, achieving universal adoption of the standards has been a multi-year effort.</p>

	<p>The implemented technology environment and workflow within large healthcare organizations is extensive. In some cases, it is not feasible to modify aged systems, especially those that will soon be retired. Organizations should examine the pros and cons of various standards for every system they build or buy, and document exceptions as they arise.</p>
