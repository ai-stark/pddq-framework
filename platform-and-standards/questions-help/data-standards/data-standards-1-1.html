	<p>The motivation to adopt data standards can result from any number of internal and external events. For larger organizations, standards typically evolve from broader architectural initiatives: technology architecture transformation, data store integration, custom system migration to a vendor product, etc. They can also result from external drivers, such as new industry policies and mandates, regulatory reporting, data exchange standards, etc.</p>

	<p>Patient identity integrity depends on matching records from disparate data stores back to a single person. The attributes needed to ensure a correct match tend to be similar along the continuum of care, however the naming conventions and formats often differ. As a result, patient records cannot be automatically reconciled without costly and inefficient manual intervention. Manual processes are prone to error, and incorrect patient record matching poses significant risks to patient safety. It is recommended to establish and follow consistent standards along the entire patient demographic data lifecycle to minimize risks.</p>
