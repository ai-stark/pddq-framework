	<p>Historical data is often needed to research and resolve business problems. For example, data profiling, data quality assessments, and data cleansing activities will aim to discover, evaluate, and utilize historical data to identify candidate patient record duplicates to be merged. To improve patient identity integrity across the patient demographic data lifecycle, it is important for the organization to capture, maintain,  and access historical data if possible.</p>
