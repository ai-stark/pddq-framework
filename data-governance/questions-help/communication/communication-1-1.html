	<p>The type and frequency of communication may vary significantly along the lifecycle of patient demographic data. Therefore, it is important to have a communication plan that has been defined, documented, approved by stakeholders, and scheduled. A communications plan can be as short as one page, and it typically includes a matrix for guiding communications.</p>

	<p>The matrix may consist of the following designations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Topic: (e.g., patient demographic data quality);</li>
		<li>Subject: (e.g., policy, process, guidelines, standards, templates, requirements);</li>
		<li>Audience (may include): Patients, registrars, front desk staff, billing, schedulers, providers, nursing staff, medical assistants, laboratory personnel, health information management staff, business office staff, information system staff, and other system users; and</li>
		<li>Frequency: (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Spending the time to think through communications about patient demographic data will reduce unnecessary confusion. A plan also serves as a baseline against which progress can be measured.</p>
