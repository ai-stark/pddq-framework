	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>
	
	<p>Over time, stakeholders such as providers, laboratory personnel, etc. may express varying needs and requirements for patient demographic data. This can result in inefficiencies and defects occurring along the patient demographic data lifecycle.</p>

	<p>Where possible, it is important to measure for desired changes in behavior resulting from communications, such as monitoring for adherence to name and address standards for patient demographic data when input into authoritative systems along the lifecycle. Communicating changes in policies and processes effectively can directly result in improvements in the quality of patient demographic data. For example, tracking the record creation error rate is one appropriate measure for an administrative dashboard. A reduction in the error creation rate following a communication of a policy change might indicate that it has resulted in more accurate patient demographic data.</p>
