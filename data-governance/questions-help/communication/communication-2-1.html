	<p>The communications planning matrix can provide the structure for status reporting. For example, the communications requirements of data entry personnel may differ depending on whether they are co-located or geographically dispersed (e.g., a “lunch and learn” session would not reach all stakeholders who are in various locations). Measuring feedback, for example email receipt, corresponding to communications sent by type, in addition to capturing website visitors or repository access, are examples of determining if communication is reaching the intended audience.</p>
