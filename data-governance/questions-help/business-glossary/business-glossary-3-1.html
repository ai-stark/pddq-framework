	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>

	<p>A business glossary not only supports the consolidation of multiple sources of common data but is also a valuable resource for defining and understanding data requirements.  Therefore, it is a best practice to embed a standard process for developing and updating glossary terms in the organizationâ€™s selection process for new technologies, e.g., Health IT Modules.</p>

	<p>Business glossary terms often have one-to-many relationships to metadata, because the same concept has multiple instantiations. For example, a precise definition of the concept of patient may require that multiple types of patients need to be identified. Attributes in the context of an implemented system may describe predetermined values or associated rules. For example, a record for a deceased patient must have a date of death, an aged record may be deemed an inactive patient, etc.</p>
