	<p>Even though business glossary terms are not physically implemented per se, changes in their meaning may have significant impacts due to one-to-many relationships with metadata, both from single concept to multiple instantiations, and the fact that glossary terms may define a collection of attributes as well as codes and values across multiple attributes. Therefore, a change in definition may result in modified rules for stored data, e.g., defining a “suffix” as separate from “last name” can have impacts that need to be evaluated.  For example, identification of those systems in which a suffix can be typed into a last name field. Changes to business terms should be approved by a governance body that represents the impacted stakeholders.</p>
