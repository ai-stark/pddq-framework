	<p>Improving and sustaining high quality patient demographic data depends on standard attributes that collectively ensure that each patient record is complete and unique. Provided the metadata standard is adhered to, it helps to ensure that the data necessary to perform key business tasks is available and, when provided, efficiently align with other systems.</p>

	<p>Standard metadata cannot be relied upon without a trustworthy business glossary, as it represents agreement on the language and meaning among key stakeholders pertaining to the patient data needed to support quality care, efficient payments, and patient safety. Moreover, if business terminology is not uniquely named and defined, then confusion and inefficiency will result.</p>

	<p>In order to ensure data attributes are uniquely and precisely specified, many organizations design logical data models that reference approved business glossary terms. It is also a best practice to store and maintain glossary entries in a centralized repository, link them to the related metadata, and assign them a unique identifier.</p>

	<p>Example Work Products</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Defined business terms in project documentation</li>
		<li>Business glossary maintained by a business unit</li>
