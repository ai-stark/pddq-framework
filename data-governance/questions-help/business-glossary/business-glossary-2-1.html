	<p>For most organizations, the business glossary is an afterthought that emerges when confusion over the meaning of metadata surfaces. This most often occurs when data is integrated into a common container, i.e., a data warehouse. In particular, matching patient demographic data from multiple sources is hampered by inconsistently described metadata.  When tied to common terms and meanings, this could be more easily reconciled. For example, how people of different ethnic backgrounds use their family names can be addressed through precise definitions. These definitions inform business rules that specify specific process and procedural steps, for instance, those taken at the point of initial patient registration.</p>

	<p>A key discriminator differentiating the business glossary from other types of metadata is that it serves primarily as a business knowledge resource. Once a key concept has been precisely named and defined, it can be replicated through metadata in multiple and disparate systems while ensuring a higher degree of affinity with an authoritative meaning on which all stakeholders agree.</p>
