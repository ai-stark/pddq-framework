	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>

	<p>Creating a data management role is recommended to improve the consistency of practices and develop the key work products and guidelines that are needed to manage patient demographic data across its lifecycle, including: specifying business terms and metadata; evaluating and improving data quality; and developing and maintaining data standards.</p> 

	<p>If patient data is to be effectively merged by a vendor, a designated resource is needed to work with participants in the patient registration process, as well as all relevant producers and consumers, to ensure and maintain continuity of critical data across the organization.  It is advisable for the data management role to coordinate with health information management staff, who are monitoring patient registration data along the entire lifecycle, and work closely with data governance.</p>
