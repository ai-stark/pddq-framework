	<p>The absence of a designated data management function leads to uncoordinated, ad hoc efforts. Typically, patient record discrepancies are addressed by business departments within a hospital, such as the registration and health information management departments. Since they often do not have end-to-end visibility of the entire patient demographic data lifecycle, it takes more effort to elevate data quality issues for resolution.</p>

	<p>To achieve the goal of improved patient data quality for safety and better care, data management activities should be coordinated across the data lifecycle, with adoption of standard processes and an established a cross-functional governance team that is charged with achieving measurable objectives (e.g., improving completeness, conformity with organization standards, and reducing duplicate records).</p>

	<p>Some healthcare organizations recognize the ongoing nature of this problem and have instituted a permanent data management function aligned with data governance.</p>
