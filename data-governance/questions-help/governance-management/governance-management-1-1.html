	<p>From scheduling a doctor visit to fillling a prescription, patients encounter people performing different processes at various stages of receiving health care services. In some cases, applications may be used that share data with other applications; in other cases, the applications may be linked, but have inadequate controls for ensuring the integrity of records in the data store. Either way, duplicate patient records are a common result of inadequate collaboration across the lifecycle and can present significant risks to patient safety.</p> 

	<p>Patient identity integrity is often compromised as a result of differences in the terminology, design, and processing of common data used along the patient care continuum. Therefore, it is important to improve communications to increase collaboration between the people and processes that collectively impact the quality of patient care.</p>

	<p>Data governance is the mechanism for facilitating common agreements about shared data. It should have a structure that includes roles, responsibilities, and accountability for key stakeholders. The goal is to improve the flow of data across the lifecycle with minimal confusion or need for rework (See <em>Data Lifecycle Management</em>).</p>

	<p>Data governance roles typically include:</p>
