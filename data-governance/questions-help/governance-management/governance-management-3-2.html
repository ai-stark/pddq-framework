	<p>Data governance processes should be standardized to improve collaboration among all stakeholders impacting patient demographic data. Typically, data governance roles and responsibilities are only part of a stakeholderâ€™s overall responsibilities. Training on data governance processes is necessary to ensure successful alignment of activities significantly impacting patient demographic data quality objectives.</p>

	<p>Data governances processes should extend to data management activities not owned by the data management function, but are needed to support improved patient demographic data quality across the lifecycle. For example, data governance processes should exist to guide development and delivery of scalable training to support the consistent capture and verification of critical patient demographic data attributes2. Training should also address best practices for defining business terms and metadata, which can be rolled out to business stakeholders beyond governance delegates.</p>
