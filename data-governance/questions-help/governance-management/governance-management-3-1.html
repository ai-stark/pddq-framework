	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>

	<p>Data governance is the central hub responsible for data management oversight. Stakeholders should collectively review and guide all critical data management activities that are being performed on patient demographic data across the lifecycle. Accordingly, metrics are essential to monitoring progress that is being made, as well as to informing collective decisions that impact the quality objectives established for patient demographic data.</p>

	<p>Data governance metrics should be consistent with the organization’s business objectives and should be updated to maintain alignment with business goals (e.g., patient safety). The progress of data governance best reflects the organization’s increasing capabilities and maturity.</p>
