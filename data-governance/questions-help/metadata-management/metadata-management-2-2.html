	<p>Business metadata includes categories such as Person and Address, but may also include non-demographic categories of data such as Clinical, Facility, etc.  Business properties may include type of person, such as patient, physician, nurse, etc. In addition, properties that represent operational and technical attributes associated with the data should also be included, such as steward, time stamp, data owner, who updated the record, etc.</p>

	<p>Standards should be established to define the conventions to be adopted across the lifecycle to ensure consistency of data flow with minimal need for rework. In particular, if metadata standards are not enforced there is a risk of inconsistent population of fields, leading to an increase in duplicate patient records. This can be addressed through policies and the implementation of controls that restrict data entry to standard codes, values, and formats in the data store that provides initial capture.</p>

	<p>It is a best practice for the organizationâ€™s metadata repository to be populated with additional categories and classifications of metadata according to a phased implementation plan. It is equally important to be linked to the implemented architecture components. Metadata, and any changes to metadata, should be validated against existing data stores (physical column names, etc.) to ensure that data store designs match the built environment, and so that discrepancies between the design and build can be identified, documented, and approved.</p>
