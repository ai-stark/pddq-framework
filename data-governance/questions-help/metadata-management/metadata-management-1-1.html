	<p>Metadata documentation is valuable when there is a need to determine if the data required for a new system, profiling effort, or algorithm is both available and appropriate to the task. For example, the proposed requirements for patient demographic data matching algorithms include, at a minimum, the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Given Name</li>
		<li>Last Name</li>
		<li>Date of Birth</li>
		<li>Administrative Gender</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Metadata should be clearly described and stored in a location that is easily accessible for all relevant stakeholders.  Defining and populating metadata is a task that has few dependencies.  It can be conducted in manageable phases, either standalone or associated with new development efforts, depending on the resources and needs of the organization.</p>

	<p>Example Work Products</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Metadata compendium or virtual metadata repository (single or multiple sources)</li>
	</ul>
