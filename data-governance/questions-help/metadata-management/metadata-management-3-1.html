	<p>Even when metadata is developed in accordance with a defined process, the overall management of metadata is complex and requires thoughtful planning to ensure success. There are tools, processes, and people involved in the ongoing management of metadata. Plans help to align resources with goals and objectives to ensure that metadata is steadily evolving to describe the patient demographic data environment well, as well as being managed effectively.  The plan should include the following topics:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Goals and objectives for metadata management;</li>
		<li>A RACI chart (e.g., governance teams, subject matter experts, other stakeholders);</li>
		<li>The metadata scope (categories, properties, and other metadata attributes);</li>
		<li>Tool / mechanism selection or maintenance process; and</li>
		<li>Sequence plan describing how the organization will develop and populate metadata.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The metadata plan should address the lifecycle of patient demographic data, as well as any external standards that may be beneficial to adopt to improve interoperability with relevant industry participants and regulators.</p>

	<p>Example Work Products</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Metadata management plan</li>
		<li>Metadata responsibilities for data management function</li>
		<li>Metadata management organization standards</li>
		<li>Gap analysis results comparing implemented platforms against metadata</li>
		<li>Metadata sequence plan milestone and progress reports</li>
	</ul>
