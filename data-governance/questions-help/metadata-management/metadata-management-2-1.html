	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>

	<p>When a new data store is built or software services are acquired, there is new metadata to be captured and managed. Many organizations view defining metadata primarily as a necessary but minor task required to complete a requirements or design document. If different teams are creating their own metadata for a point solution, the organization does not realize the cumulative benefits of accurate, standardized metadata. As a result, metadata is often poorly and inconsistently defined, captured, and linked across the lifecycle.</p>

	<p>For any data that is highly shared, such as patient demographic data, it is best to engage business representation through governance to define and approve the metadata scope (Business, Technical, and Operational) that will be captured, standardized, and managed.</p>

	<p>Adopting consistent formats and acceptable values and adhering to them are important and should be emphasized in a defined process. However, accurately describing what the data represents is even more critical. This is why it is important to work starting from the business terms to related metadata representations. For example, an inconsistent approach to use of legal names versus nicknames can cause duplicate patient records.</p>
