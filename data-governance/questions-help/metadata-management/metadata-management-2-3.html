	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>

	<p>While changes to metadata may occur infrequently, they can have significant impacts on downstream systems and users. The trigger for a metadata change can be the implementation of a new system, updates to an existing system, or updates to related business glossary terms and definitions. For example, a change in the business glossary definition for last name may result in the need to add a suffix attribute to every system that allows its inclusion in family name and a redefinition of all metadata related to last name.</p>

	<p>Knowledge of applicable systems and users of patient demographic data is needed to conduct an impact assessment on data changes. Therefore, operational metadata should document all stakeholders of a data set across the lifecycle. Because adding metadata to the implemented environment can be costly, organizations may require statistical proof that proposed additional data attributes would improve the quality of patient demographic data and record matching before undertaking to adopt an external standard.</p>
