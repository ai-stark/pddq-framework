	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>

	<p>Quality rules and manual work arounds are most often used to resolve data defects with little if any attention paid to identifying their root causes. The root cause of data defects is most often at the point of origin (upstream).  A significant percentage are the result of human error with the remainder being due to sub-optimal design. Typos, misspellings, transpositions, fields left empty, or fields filled with false data can all cause problems for consumers downstream from the point of entry.</p>

	<p>Whatever the cause of the defect, improving the process, especially at the original point of data input or acquisition, can resolve most defects (because process improvements may also lead to design changes or addition of automated quality rules). For example, most health systems, as a best practice, now require registrars to search for an existing patient record before creating a new record. Some organizations have improved the process, requiring that registrars scan and check a photo ID, which is also helpful for reducing the risk of fraudulent use of a patientâ€™s insurance coverage.<sup>4</sup> Once the data has been corrected, it is important to communicate data changes to all relevant stakeholders.</p>

	<p>For example, healthcare organizations agree that any changes to patient data attributes in exchange transactions should be coordinated with organizations working on parallel efforts to standardize healthcare transactions.</p>
