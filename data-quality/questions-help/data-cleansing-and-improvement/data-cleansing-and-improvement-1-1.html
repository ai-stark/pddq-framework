	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>

	<p>Data cleansing requirements may result from the identification of data defects through various sources, e.g., change requests, report inaccuracies, defect logs, etc. However, it is particularly important to regularly conduct data profiling and data quality assessments, which can catch defects before they negatively impact patient safety. Defects should be translated into documented cleansing requirements.</p>

	<p>Data cleansing requirements will specify exactly what data needs to be cleansed and the rules that should be applied. The cleansing rules, scripts, or procedures are intended to be reused since the cleansing process will be repeated consistently over time.  The document may include the following content:  A statement of the defect, and its impact on operational objectives;  A definition of the scope of data to be addressed; and  The benefits that will result from improved data quality.</p>

	<p>Defining the benefits of improving the data will most likely require knowledge of business rules, data definitions, usage impacts, etc. Data cleansing requirements should adhere to quality criteria that are expressed in terms of data quality dimensions (i.e., conformity, accuracy, uniqueness) and linked to business objectives, such as making measurable improvements on patient safety.</p>

	<p>For example, one organization hired a contractor to assist in a 10-month data cleansing effort that included an analysis exploring the hospital’s entire identity integrity process. The root cause of every duplicate was documented, and a resolution plan was created.<sup><a href="#subscript-6">6</a></sup></p>
