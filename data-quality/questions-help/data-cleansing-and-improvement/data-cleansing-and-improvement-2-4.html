	<p>Addressing data defects at the source, when possible, will increase efficiency and improve stakeholdersâ€™ confidence in the quality of the data. This is especially important, since some organizations invest in manual review of potential duplicates out of fear of automating false positive matches that could have serious patient safety repercussions. As a result, there is a strong industry interest in establishing policies internally and industry-wide that call for adherence to standard procedures in the patient registration process.</p>

	<p>While it is not always possible to make changes at the original source of data capture, it is important to hold data providers accountable for the quality of their data. (<em>See Provider Management.</em>)</p>
