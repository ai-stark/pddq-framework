	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>

	<p>It is important to determine a prioritization method for identifying the most important defects to resolve. Commonly used approaches include estimates of the costs of fixes, the level of effort, characterization of the business impact, and tangible and intangible benefits.</p>

	<p>For example, the average cost of a duplicate patient record has been estimated by one organization to be $96 and total impact on patient care at 4% (delayed surgeries, duplicated lab tests, and imaging).  The organization prioritized reducing the duplicate rate, which was cut from 22 % to .14 %, due to the high cost of the issue.<sup>5</sup></p>

	<p>The methods for assessing business impacts, including costs and risks, should be defined, approved, and consistently applied across the patient demographic data lifecycle. This enables a standard baseline to be established for each cleansing initiative, allowing for cross-comparability and easier measurement of progress.</p>
