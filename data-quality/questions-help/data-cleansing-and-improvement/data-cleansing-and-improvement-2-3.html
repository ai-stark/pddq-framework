	<p>Time-series analysis of defect patterns will often indicate the root cause. Addressing root causes results in scalable solutions and increased confidence in the quality of the data. Therefore, maintaining an archive of data changes supports sustainable data quality effectiveness. For example, many organizations require a patientâ€™s previous name and previous address change history for updates.</p>

	<p>All demographic updates should be logged with a date and time stamp and the user identifier or other source of the change. The organization should also produce (or acquire from the EHR) and maintain reports for all patient record merges.</p>
