	<p>It is important for quality rules to be implemented consistently across the data lifecycle in order to ensure data consistency and insulate data improvement efforts against being accidentally undermined by inconsistent data handling in downstream systems.</p>

	<p>The lack of standard patient matching processes and technologies threatens patient safety and organizational efficiency, which will be exacerbated as interoperability increases in various forms. For example, patient record matching algorithms that differ widely in terms of required attributes and precedence rules sometimes result in incorrectly merged records that cannot be unmerged.</p>
