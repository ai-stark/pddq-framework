	<p>Data quality assessments typically result in the implementation of data quality rules that are informed by business knowledge of the data. These rules are needed to properly handle data and define required data elements, formats, and timeliness parameters through either manual entry or automated ingestion from bulk data sources (e.g., .TXT, .CSV, .XLS, etc.). It is important to specify rules before data migrations, connections to external systems such as Health Information Exchanges and extractions to repositories for analytics. As assessments are conducted, rules are added and refined until the quality of the data set surpasses the required threshold expressed by the relevant stakeholders and until the quality approaches or reaches the targets.</p>

	<p>It is important that high-level information in data quality assessment reports can be traced back to individual records to ensure that current thresholds and targets are accurately met.  The organization should work with vendors to ensure availability and access to data, as well as timely and accurate reports.</p>
