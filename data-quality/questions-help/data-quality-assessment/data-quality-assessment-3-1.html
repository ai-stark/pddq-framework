	<p>A data quality assessment policy should be developed after creating the organizationâ€™s data quality plan (See Data Quality Planning). The policy should provide guidance on the selection of data sets, availability of data, alignment of data across systems, the types of methods and measures by which data quality should be assessed, the frequency and/or event triggers for conducting assessments, and the conditions for ensuring alignment with organizational objectives (i.e., governance sign-off) as well as compliance with the policy.</p>
