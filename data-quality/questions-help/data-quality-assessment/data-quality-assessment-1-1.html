	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>

	<p>When an organization establishes agreement on high-level objectives, such as assuring unique records in patient demographic data stores, it is better able to bring different perspectives into alignment around shared data assets.</p>

	<p>Practically every step along the care continuum benefits from unambiguous patient records. However, the priority placed on the value of that uniqueness may vary, as well as the level of accuracy for the attributes used to ensure that uniqueness. Initial priorities often are driven by the primary purposes for which the data is collected.  If the collective needs of all relevant suppliers and consumers are not addressed, there is a risk of negative downstream impacts.</p>

	<p>For example, the accuracy of insurance information is very important for billing. Patient registration staff may consider that to be less important for the purpose of delivering quality care to the patient by registration staff. However, since patient registration also benefits from patient record uniqueness to meet their objectives for patient safety, they can be trained to be aware of the importance of capturing accurate patient and insurance information.</p>
