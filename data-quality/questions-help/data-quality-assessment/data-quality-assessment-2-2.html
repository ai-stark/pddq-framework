	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>
	
	<p>Having a predetermined set of key attributes is essential to keeping the scope of data quality efforts manageable. Governance representatives should agree on the scope of attributes based on priorities that support the organizationâ€™s goals; for example, agreeing on a standard set of patient demographic attributes that will improve the ability to match duplicate patient records to support patient safety. While the optimum group of attributes is not unanimous across the industry, there is a minimum set on which many healthcare organizations agree:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>First/Given Name;</li>
		<li>Current Last/Family Name;</li>
		<li>Middle/Second Given Name;</li>
		<li>Date of Birth;</li>
		<li>Current Address (street address, city, state, ZIP code);</li>
		<li>Current Phone Number; and</li>
		<li>Gender.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Data quality assessments should be conducted periodically according to an approved frequency, per the data quality assessment policy.</p>
