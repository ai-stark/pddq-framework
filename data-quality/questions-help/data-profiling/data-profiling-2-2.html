	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>
	
	<p>Typically, an information technology resource performs data profiling and may know very little about the business meaning and criticality of the data set. Therefore, stakeholders (i.e. data stewards and owners) should be consulted to define the authoritative current state of the quality of the data set, which will serve as the baseline for tracking and quantifying improvements.</p>

	<p>Likewise, the profiling resource is responsible only for implementing defect resolution rules that have been provided as approved data quality requirements by the appropriate stakeholders (i.e., data stewards and owners).</p>
