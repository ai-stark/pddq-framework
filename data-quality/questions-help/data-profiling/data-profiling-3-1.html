	<p>It is important for data stewards to define and approve a set of data attributes to profile according to business needs (i.e., applying an algorithm to identify duplicate patient records) and specify the data stores to be profiled.</p>

	<p>Once a baseline for the data set has been established and approved, data governance should determine the frequency for the performance of periodic profiling, and review the results to establish enhancements as needed (i.e. updated data quality requirements, changes in standards, or new demographic attributes).</p>

	<p>For example, stakeholders within and across healthcare organizations agree that standardized patient identifying attributes should be required in relevant data exchange transactions to ensure interoperability.</p>
