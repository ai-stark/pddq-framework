	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>
	
	<p>Data profiling is the technical means for revealing the magnitude and frequency of differences within and across data sets. It reveals quantitative patterns in data sets, such as the distinct number of values in a field, the frequency distribution of distinct values, null or blank value counts, numeric ranges, etc. The purpose is to identify defects and anomalies, such as varying formats in the same attribute within or across systems.</p>

	<p>Even if similar data attributes are used across the continuum of care, they are usually stored in different formats. For example, a patientâ€™s middle name or middle initial may be used, the use of hyphens may differ, previously used names or nicknames may or not be captured, and people of different ethnic backgrounds may use their family names in patterns other than in terms of first, middle, and last name.</p>
