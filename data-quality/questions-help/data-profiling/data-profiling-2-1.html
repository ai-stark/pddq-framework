	<p>A data profiling method is a planned approach to analyzing data sets that is not restricted to a specific technology solution. The method serves as a process guide that defines the types of analyses to be performed, their rationale, relevant scenarios, highlevel activity steps, tests and rules to be applied, as well as report templates for results. The goal is to define the process steps and supporting work products so they are reusable across various data stores.</p>

	<p>One of the most common types of advanced profiling methods is aimed at the identification and resolution of duplicate records in a data set. The patient matching algorithms used across the healthcare industry are a classic example of both the target objective, and the difficulty in stabilizing profiling methods that work. Most algorithms for determining duplicates may require trial and error, as well as customization that is achieved through numerous iterations of data analysis and standardization.</p>
