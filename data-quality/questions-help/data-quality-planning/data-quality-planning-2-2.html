	<p>Data profiling, assessment, and cleansing activities are often performed sequentially and iteratively. The entire process is often repeated, because anomalies may surface at any point and may require analysis. Once defects have been determined, all affected steps must be refined to ensure defect rates adhere to the tolerances specified in the data quality plan. Therefore, it is important to regularly monitor the implementation of the data quality plan and make adjustments when needed.</p>
