	<p>The data quality plan should align with organizational goals (e.g., improve patient safety). Consequently, the planâ€™s objectives should support organizational goals (e.g., patient identity integrity), and the scope should address the entire lifecycle for patient demographic data. Relevant stakeholders should select the data attributes critical to important processes performed along the lifecycle.</p>

	<p>It is essential that all relevant stakeholders define and approve the quality objectives and criteria that will ensure that the data is ultimately fit for purpose. This provides guidance on the definition of thresholds and targets to be developed through data quality assessments (See <em>Data Quality Assessment</em>). In addition, it is important to understand that data quality is a learning process. Accordingly, objectives and success criteria should be updated periodically to reflect refined data quality requirements resulting from successive data cleansing, feedback, and improvement efforts.</p>
