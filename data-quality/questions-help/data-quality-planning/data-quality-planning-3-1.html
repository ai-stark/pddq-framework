	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>

	<p>Sustaining data quality over time depends on aligning the efforts of stakeholders who impact shared data at different points along the lifecycle of patient demographic data. Turnover of personnel is one of many risks to data quality that can be mitigated through effective governance.  The organization should assign clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities that are aimed to ensure a consistent stewardship of shared data assets from their creation to destruction.</p>

	<p>Assigning accountability is necessary for ensuring that the organization maintains sustainable data quality policies, repeatable processes, and effective methods. Therefore, it is recommended that the data management function carry out those responsibilities for the data quality program and serve as the assigned steward for overall data quality metrics.</p>
