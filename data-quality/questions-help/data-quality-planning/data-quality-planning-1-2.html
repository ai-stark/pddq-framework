	<p>Sustainable improvements to the quality of data require the implementation of quality rules, because data defects often result from a lack of thorough requirements analysis. Data quality rules can be implemented in the form of procedures to be followed for data entry personnel or as enhancements to data capture systems. It is best to strengthen data capture with automated quality rules whenever possible. </p>

	<p>Automation of data quality rules can range from nearly full to partial automation. For example, full automation can include exception reports that still must be manually reviewed. Nearly fully automated quality checks are typically applied to data stores, which integrate bulk data from multiple sources. Alternatively, partial automation of data quality rules is often implemented at the point of data capture, which is usually accomplished through manual entry. Here quality rules enforce the use of standards by restricting data entry to a predefined range of inputs that are stored in a consistent format (e.g., state code, phone number, ZIP code, etc.), and accommodate a diverse patient population with unique identifiers.</p>
