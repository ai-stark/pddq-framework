	<p>The relationships between data requirements may include one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. Techniques are used to design and articulate these complex interrelationships into conceptual, logical, and physical data models.  Whether the organization builds its own data stores, or purchases software or services based on a vendor data store design, it is important to be aware of any design constraints, such as allowing only one historical address to be stored, etc.</p>
