	<p>Standard business glossary terms and definitions support common understanding for shared concepts by all relevant stakeholders. Using business glossary terms as a starting point for data requirements definition ensures that similarly described data attributes can be clearly understood. Precise meaning provides the foundation for consistent data capture and interpretation.</p>

	<p>For example, Patient Name is ambiguous without additional information, whereas Patient Last Name may be overly specific for the glossary. Establishing a common term, Last Name, and giving it a precise definition can ensure that all instances of a personâ€™s last name are implemented consistently and support the same meaning. Requirements should document traceability from attributes to business glossary terms.</p>
