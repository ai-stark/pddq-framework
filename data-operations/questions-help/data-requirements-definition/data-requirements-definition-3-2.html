	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>
	
	<p>Data requirements should reflect the meaning of the data, and the meaning of the data should align with the purpose of the process. Data requirements result from the defnition of process needs. Understanding the steps involved in the processes that create, read, update, or delete data is essential to understanding the correct use of the data, to identify data owners, and to better grasp the meaning of the data (<em>See Data Lifecycle Management</em>).</p>

	<p>Providing a view into the process promotes trust in the quality of the data. Linking data to its processes also supports data quality improvement initiatives (<em>See Data Cleansing and Improvement</em>). For example, improving the patient registration process to ensure that personnel validate essential patient data attributes up front results in better quality patient demographic data overall.</p>
