	<p>The data requirements process can be documented by creating a template that is annotated with instructions. Templates ensure consistency and allow more emphasis to be given to stakeholder needs rather than how to document them.</p>

However, basic data requirements definition should include the data attributes required, metadata standards, data owners, business glossary mapping, and identification of relevant business processes to name a few (<em>See Introductory Notes</em>).</p>
