	<p>Defects and deviations should be defined within SLAs in terms of data quality dimensions. For example, if a 2-digit month, 2-digit day, and 4-digit year with seperating dashes (##-##-####) is required for Date of Birth, then 09/14/1969 while in a legitimate format, would be considered a defect. Were the date entered as 09/14/69 it could be counted as 2 defects (i.e., / vs -, 69  vs 1969).</p>

	<p>Deviations occur when defect rates exceed defined thresholds. For example, a 20% defect rate in formating would violate a 90% threshold by 10%. The process for holding a provider accountable for defects and deviations should provide guidance on the prioritization of defects and their resolution.</p>

	<p>Accordingly, critical defects might be defined as any defects beyond the threshold defect hurdle rate. The process may further specify critical defects to be resolved within one hour up to the point where the defect equals the defined threshold. Then additional defects should be adressed after other critical defects in other dimensions are resolved.</p>
