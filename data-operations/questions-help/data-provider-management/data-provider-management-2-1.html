	<p>Data quality rules and thresholds are defined in terms of data quality dimensions (See Data Quality Assessment). These requirements should be included in SLAs by key consumers with guidance and oversight from data governance.</p>  

	<p>An SLA specifies delivered services, service measures, levels of acceptable and unacceptable service, and expected responsibilities, liabilities, and actions of both the provider and customer in anticipated situations. Data governance stakeholders should monitor assessments to ensure the results are in line with the agreements.</p>
