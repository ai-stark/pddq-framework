	<p>Processes and applications that impact patient demographic data change over time. Accordingly, traceability of key data attributes along the lifecycle should be regularly reviewed and kept up to date. It can be particularly important to keep track of manual reconciliation processes. These processes can be improved, formalized, and even automated over time, resulting in a more efficient flow of patient demographic data through its lifecycle.</p>
