	<p>At a high level, the definition of the lifecycle for patient demographic data requires traceability of data from creation or acquisition through key transformations including on to final deletion or archiving. Traceability of data dependencies need not be restricted to applications that are linked through automated data feeds. Often, manual updates are made based on reports from siloed applications. For example, updates may be made by manually reviewing potentially matching patient records identified using rule-based algorithms to determine if the they refer to the same patient.</p>
