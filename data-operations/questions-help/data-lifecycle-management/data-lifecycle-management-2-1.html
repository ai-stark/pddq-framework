  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Information</h3>
	
	<p>Using disparate sources to capture the same data on the same patient is a common behavior and a typical cause of data quality issues. In some cases, different data sources may be used in the same process at different times and/or by different people. In other cases, inconsistent patient records surface when data sharing is needed to accomplish different processes along the care continuum.</p>

	<p>An authoritative data source is an official source of information that may include a trusted source or a system of record. As such, the authoritative data source may refer to the source that creates the data or the best source for a specific data set, which will depend on context.</p>

	<p>Data governance should provide guidance on how authoritative sources are to be defined, prioritized, and controlled to reduce the risk of creating inconsistent or duplicate patient records.</p>

	<p>Any quality issues identified at any point along the patient data lifecycle should be be addressed in the authoritative source to ensure all other processes will benefit from the correct information. Accordingly, the systems development lifecycle process should require reference to and adoption of approved shared data from authoritative sources.</p>
