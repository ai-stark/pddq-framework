	<p>At a minimum, the scope of data lifecycle management should address the set of critical data attributes that have been identified for ensuring a patient record can be reconciled to an actual patient. All new development and technology purchases should use the appropriate business glossary terms when documenting data requirements, and the relationships from the glossary terms to metadata corresponding to the implemented technology should be documented and subject to review by data governance.</p>

	<p>While there is no unanimity within the healthcare industry on the entire set of critical data atttributes necessary to ensure patient identity integrity within every context, there is a consensus forming around a minimum set that applies to most settings (<em>See Data Quality Assessment</em>).</p>
